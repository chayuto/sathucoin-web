# SaThuCoin (สาธุคอยน์) — Complete Reference

> Every token represents a verified act of generosity.
> ทุกโทเคนคือบันทึกแห่งการทำบุญที่ยืนยันแล้ว

SaThuCoin (SATHU) is a recognition token on the Base blockchain (Ethereum L2 by Coinbase). It is minted and given to charitable donors when their donation is verified by a participating institution — such as a temple, charity, or foundation. Each token serves as permanent, verifiable proof of generosity recorded on-chain.

The name "สาธุ" (Sathu) comes from the Thai/Pali word meaning "well done" or "amen" — traditionally spoken to express approval and shared merit in Buddhist charitable acts.

## How It Works

1. **Donation**: A donor makes a contribution to a participating institution (temple, charity, foundation).
2. **Verification**: The institution verifies the donation and submits it to the SaThuCoin smart contract.
3. **Minting**: SATHU tokens are minted and sent directly to the donor's wallet address.
4. **Recording**: The deed is permanently recorded on the Base blockchain, including the institution name and deed description.

The entire process is free for donors. They only need to provide their Ethereum/Base wallet address (which starts with 0x) to the institution when donating.

## Smart Contract Details

The SaThuCoin smart contract is deployed on Base Mainnet and includes the following features:

### Read Functions
- `name()` → "SaThuCoin"
- `symbol()` → "SATHU"
- `decimals()` → 18
- `totalSupply()` → Total tokens minted so far
- `cap()` → Maximum supply cap
- `balanceOf(address)` → Token balance for a given wallet
- `paused()` → Whether minting is currently paused
- `dailyMintedToday()` → Tokens minted in the current day
- `MAX_DAILY_MINT()` → Maximum tokens that can be minted per day
- `MAX_MINT_PER_TX()` → Maximum tokens per single transaction

### Events

### Safety Features
- Supply cap prevents unlimited minting
- Daily mint limit controls the rate of token issuance
- Per-transaction limit prevents large single mints
- Pausable by contract owner for emergencies

Donors can check their SATHU balance on the website by:

## Thai Cultural Context

In Thai Buddhist culture, "ทำบุญ" (tham boon / making merit) is a deeply important practice. Donations to temples and charitable organizations are seen as acts that generate spiritual merit. "สาธุ" (sathu) is spoken to express approval, gratitude, and shared joy in these acts of generosity.

SaThuCoin bridges this cultural tradition with modern blockchain technology, creating a permanent digital record of merit-making that respects and extends the spirit of "อนุโมทนา" (anumoethana — rejoicing in others' generosity).

Key Thai terms used in the project:
- **สาธุ** (Sathu) — "Well done" / "Amen" — expressing approval of a good deed
- **ทำบุญ** (Tham Boon) — Making merit through charitable acts
- **อนุโมทนา** (Anumoethana) — Rejoicing in the merit of others
- **บุญ** (Boon) — Merit, spiritual credit from good deeds
- **ผู้บริจาค** (Phu Borijak) — Donor
- **องค์กร** (Ongkon) — Organization / Institution
